/*
BRONZE: Create a Netflix class with Properties of Name, Genre, Rating. Create three objects from that class.

SILVER: Create a method called GetSuggestion() that returns different messages if 
the Rating is over 4 to the console that says, "You should definitely watch 
this show." The else message could be "You probably won't want to watch this show".

GOLD: Create a list of objects based on the Netflix class.
Write a foreach loop that would iterate over the loop and print
the name, genre, and rating of each object.
