HELP! My code isn't working for some reason! It's printing this Michael Bolton thing out. I don't want that!
Can you fix it?

I need help!!!!

We also need 2 more subclasses of music and objects to announce some better music, all with the AnnounceGreatMusic Functions.


Also, if you think that Michael Bolton is the best, please leave now.
