          BRONZE CHALLENGE:
              Create a list of value types. (int, string, bool, float, double, decimal)
              Create two examples for each type. One is a declaration only. The other is a declaration with initializer.
              Print a view of the values in the console.

          SILVER CHALLENGE:
              Use those types to concatenate a string. 

          GOLD CHALLENGE: 
              Declare the year you were born as a string. 
              Convert it to an integer and print it with a message in the console.
              For instance, "I was born in 1976."   */
